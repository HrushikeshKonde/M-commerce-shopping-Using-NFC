# M-commerce-shopping-Using-NFC
This project is based on Android based M-commerce application using NFC. NFC stands for Near Field Communication. It would require Mobile Devices which support NFC technology. NFC is a wireless technology which is a short-range, high frequency, low bandwidth radio technology that allows transferring data within few centimeters. In traditional shopping, the customer needs to physically pick up the items to be purchased and carry cash or credit/debit cards with them to make payments. The application will read the NFC tag of the product and add it to the shopping cart in our application. It would also provide methods to change the quantity of products purchased and edit the cart. Invoice will be generated and NFC based payment will be done according to the generated invoice.
